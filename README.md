# cryp-to-go

## idea

- easy to use high-level crypto library for file encryption
- can use generated encryption keys from password + salt
- can generate random keys as encrypt them by SSL public key
- can handle HMAC signatures of encrypted data
- store multiple info in SQLite (peewee?)
- extract single-file info as JSON
- CLI
- GUI (web-based)
