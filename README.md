# cryp-to-go

## What is it?

- easy to use high-level crypto library for encrypted data storage/exchange
- can use derived encryption keys from password + salt
- can generate random keys and encrypt them by SSL public key (one or multiple)
- can handle HMAC signatures of encrypted data
- store multiple files in SQLite (ORM via peewee)
- store all necessary information and data in a single SQLite file
- store encrypted key/value pairs in SQLite (for usage in other python programs)
- allow encryption/decryption of streams (for usage in python programs that handle large data)
- CLI for file -> SQLite encryption
- based on cryptography and pynacl libraries
